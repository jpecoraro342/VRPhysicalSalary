This concept and \r\nthe motivation behind our project comes from the following XKCD article titled \r\nPhysical Salary: https://what-if.xkcd.com/118/. The article imagines a scenario \r\nin which the earnings by a certain worker is spawned physically into the room \r\nevery second throughout the length of a work day. The sheer difference in \r\nearnings per second, minute, hour or day earned by different workers is easily \r\nanalyzed using this method.\r\n\r\nWe used this method in our project to display the difference in earnings by \r\nincome level. The level is split into two sections, the main hall and the \r\ncomparator room. \r\n\r\nThe main hall has three sections, separated by income level: low, medium and \r\nhigh. Each income section has three glass rooms in which a different kind of \r\nworker, such \r\nas a janitor or teacher, and have been assigned an income dispenser set to the \r\naverage earnings of their profession. When the user toggles the panel in front \r\nof a room, money (coins or other) will be spawned at an equivalent rate to how \r\nmuch that worker would earn per second on the job.\r\n\r\nThe comparator room allows the user to spawn in two different rooms from the \r\nmain area and observe them side-by-side. There are two glass rooms here, with a \r\npanel in front allowing the user to select which worker they would like to see. \r\n\r\n### Learning Objective \r\nAfter the VR experience, participants will have a more profound understanding \r\nin the difference of wealth earned between varying income levels.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n- [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/tG1D1sluiyQ)\r\n- [iOS Project](http://cise.ufl.edu/~jp2/PhysicalSalaryVR.zip)\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nAll Character Animations & Character Rigging: https://mixamo.com \r\n\r\nCEO Office Models:\r\n- https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=ue9853bb1-02d4-44c4-9d5c-d0393a858136\r\n- https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/51662\r\n- iPhone Model: https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=ucf036023-cf27-4674-9b52-68c093f2a1dd \r\n\r\nFootball Player & Locker Room:\r\n- https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/3355\r\n- https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/41535\r\n\r\nTeacher Model: http://www.turbosquid.com/FullPreview/Index.cfm/ID/560283\r\n\r\nPolice Officer Car: https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=b010e60149b4abe066a4797d39dbf2b\r\n\r\nNurse Model & Props: \r\n- Model: http://tf3dm.com/3d-model/nurse-sinclair-32354.html \r\n- Doctorâ€™s Office: https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=9646723bbf608fb871863225e6cc4ec5 \r\n\r\nSoftware Developer Oculus Rift Model:  https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=u9f62170a-781f-41ce-90bc-140b04b145dc \r\n\r\nFast Food Structure: \r\n- https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=u3bee3d7f-489d-4b87-8e3d-\r\nae7e29418265\r\n\r\nRetail Models:\r\n- https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=40e7b93202aa7a173aaf398005337494\r\n- https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=a012584a2b3d0cd93aaf398005337494\r\n- https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=5dbb2120f2f828d28aaae3d020f5ddf8\r\n\r\nTeacher Models:\r\n- https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=f4abfac119a7aecc6553eb23613ec7c8\r\n- https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=39e59999bb2ad6e918b188ddf020af53\r\n- https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=fb01ac920e6b68fd7236c5b88164c0b8\r\n- https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=u8a74ddbc-bafc-4ae8-ba34-6fce2b3f7bc7\r\n- https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=421ad85cbba562878fc3447f3635506f\r\n- https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=3b561fce434f037a337a1856b644671\r\n- https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=1b911ffee868e8bd4f354e706ff076f\r\n- https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=539e854825d532e7a4bd4f46ba404890",
